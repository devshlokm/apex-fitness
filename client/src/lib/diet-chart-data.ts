  "The Protein Reality: Even with high-protein food choices, you will consistently land in the 130-150g protein range daily. To hit the optimal 180-200g needed for your goals, a second scoop of whey protein is a strategic necessity.",
  "The Oil Trap: All calculations assume minimal cooking oil (1-2 teaspoons per meal). Oil is the biggest source of hidden calories. Measure it.",
  "Hydration: Drink 3-4 liters of water daily. It is a non-negotiable tool for performance, recovery, and metabolism.",
  "Consistency Over Perfection: The goal isn't to hit 2300 calories with military precision. The goal is to be consistent with the process. A 100-200 calorie variance day-to-day is irrelevant. The weekly average is what drives results.",
